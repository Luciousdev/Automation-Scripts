# Laravel generator

## About

Here you can find the laravel installation in seperate files instead of the bundled script.py file. These files in here are not tested but because they're copied from the script.py I do not see any reason why it won't work. Unless I made a big poopoo 

## Requirements

You'll need to have PHP version 8.1 and composer installed for the script to work.

## Known issues (with solution)

Depending on how you installed composer on windows the program will not detect it. The troubleshoot issues for this are to reinstall composer and add it to path (path is different based on your installation). Personally I had the most luck with installing composer through the terminal/konsole.
