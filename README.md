# Automation scripts

## What is this?

I've been making some simple python script for projects that I start. For example I use electron a lot and this will help to speed up my workflow.
I will be making more of these script and they will be free for anyone to download and use. I'm trying to not use any packages that aren't default in python but sometimes there's no choice.
When there are other packages to be installed it will be said in the README and in a requirements.txt.
